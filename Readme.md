qmongo
======

This repo contains some experimental code for talking to a mongodb database.
It is a branch off the [qbson](https://github.com/andrasq/node-qbson) BSON coders,
which itself was a spin-off from the 2016 Kinvey Spring Hackathon.

This is a fork of [node-qbson](https://github.com/andrasq/node-qbson) that
included all the early development.
